Calibration:

- How to incentivize the model to improve calibration ?

- Somehow adapt query strategy to combine uncertainty measure with calibration measure. (ECE,MCE,Brier score?)

	- Not feasible to compute calibration measure on unlabeled data ? (Only compute on already labeled ? To chekc if add. labels ?)
	
	- Simulate labels and retrain to observe calibration change ? Expensive ?
	
	- Identify regions where calibration is bad e.g. specific bins ? Adapt query strategy to prioritize those regions ?
